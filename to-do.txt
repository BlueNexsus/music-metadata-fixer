🧩 MetadataFixer – To-Do List (v2.1.0 → v2.2.0 Roadmap)
🧠 Context

The app is now stable with:

CustomTkinter GUI ✅

Working progress bar ✅

Automatic AcoustID API key setup ✅

Successful .exe build with version info ✅

Remaining polish targets focus on UX refinement, design consistency, and background process handling.

✅ 1. Simplify folder handling (remove duplication)

Goal: Eliminate confusion between Music Folder (GUI) and ROOT_FOLDER (.env).

Steps:

In core/file_utils.py → ensure_env_setup()

Remove any logic asking for or validating ROOT_FOLDER.

Keep only API key prompt & save logic.

In gui_metadata_fixer.py → browse_folder()

After user selects a folder, add:

from dotenv import set_key
set_key(".env", "ROOT_FOLDER", folder)


This ensures the chosen folder is auto-saved to .env for future runs.

Result:
First launch asks for API key once → future launches reuse last selected folder automatically.

🧰 2. Silence the fpcalc.exe console window

Goal: Stop the “split-second cmd window” from appearing during fingerprinting.

Steps:

In core/tagger.py, find where acoustid.match(api_key, path) is called.

Wrap AcoustID’s subprocess calls with a hidden startupinfo:

import subprocess
startupinfo = subprocess.STARTUPINFO()
startupinfo.dwFlags |= subprocess.STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW


(We’ll integrate this into a helper so it applies globally.)

Result:
Fingerprinting runs silently in background without console flashes.

🎨 3. GUI design improvements

Ideas to explore:

Add small footer label:
"v2.1.0 • © BlueNexsus • github.com/BlueNexsus/music-metadata-fixer"

Use consistent padding and alignment for a cleaner, modern look.

Optionally add a dark “glass” background for the progress bar.

Add a small icon to the window (bundled .ico file).

📦 4. Packaging & usability

Exclude .env from PyInstaller build permanently (--exclude-data or manual cleanup).

After build, confirm:

First run asks for API key only.

Folder choice persists in .env.

Progress bar still updates correctly.

Update version_info.txt → v2.2.0 after changes.

📘 5. Optional future upgrades

Add cancel button to stop current tagging thread safely.

Include an “About” popup with credits & GitHub link.

Auto-detect existing .env and display a setup summary on launch.

Explore lightweight async tagging for smoother GUI feedback.
